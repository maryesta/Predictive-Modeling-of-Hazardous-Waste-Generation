# Predictive Modeling of Hazardous Waste Generation
Finalist in National Data Science Competition Fortex 5.0 by Universitas Al-Azhar
- A machine learning model was developed to predict the total hazardous waste generated in the ten most populous states in the United States as part of the Final National Data Science Competition by Universitas Al Azhar. The project utilized data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and followed the CRISP-DM methodology, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering. Techniques such as K-Means clustering for geographical segmentation, feature importance analysis, and SHAP values were employed to interpret model results. Ridge Regression was selected as the best-performing model after hyperparameter tuning, achieving optimal results with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.
